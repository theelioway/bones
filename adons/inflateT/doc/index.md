## WTF

An default endpoint which searches subdirectores for any which contain a `thing.json` file and lists them in the same tree structure.

- Each `thing.json` could also come with a corresponding "bones.js" that would drive a different kind of its own `inflateT` (like prep some thumbnails of the images mentioned in the `thing.json` list).

- You could swap `inflateT` or add a similar feature with a differently name endpoint which initialises the app from some starting data... for instance, spidering a Wiki entry to takeonT a list of Colombian birds from the page there.

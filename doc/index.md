**bones** REST API for <https://schema.org> mongoose schema spidered the elioWay.

## WTF

Reusable endpoints for **elioBones** projects.

## Ribs

Its ribs are 10 endpoints and are the heart of **elioWay** projects.

### The TURDs

Four **elioEngage** operations:

- `takeupT` As in "take up carpentry". The "record create" endpoint.
- `updateT` The "record update" endpoint.
- `readT` The "record get" endpoint.
- `deleteT` The "record delete" endpoint.

### The LUTEs

Four **elioList** endpoints:

- `listT` The "list all relateds record" endpoint.
- `unlistT` The "record remove from list" endpoint.
- `takeonT` The "record create and add to list" endpoint.
- `enlistT` The "record add to list" endpoint.

### PS

Two **elioSchema** endpoints:

- `pingT` An endpoint for checking the availability of endpoints.
- `schemaT` An endpoint for getting metadata, or for getting a new blank record.

### Auth

Two **elioEngage** endpoints:

- `loginT` An endpoint for logging into a thing. You won't ever log into elioWay - you log into every app separately.
- `logoutT` An endpoint for logging out of an app.

## Other bones

## Spine

These are called internally by the ribs, but could be useful:

- `authT` An endpoint for checking the user is Permitted to call each endpoint.
- `engageT` An endpoint which is a light wrapper for opening.
- `permitT` Called by `authT` endpoint for checking the user is Permitted.

As long as the endpoint acts upon a complete `thing`, with or without a list, and returns the payload correctly formatted, it is an **elioBone**.

### IOU

Here are, for instance, three **elioOptimize** endpoints, the very least we could do. We expect you'll need more. You'll have to write those and share them. We'll share any we write here as well. But for now... It's the least I owe.

- `inflateT` Search subdirectores to `takeonT` any which contain a `thing.json` file.
- `optimizeT` Report on the combined `Action.actionStatus` of listed things.
- `undoT` Reverse data changes by going back a certain number of steps.

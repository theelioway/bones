# Installing bones

- [bones Prerequisites](/eliobones/bones/prerequisites.html)

**WARNING**

**bones** is primarily intended for learning **NodeJs**, the **elioWay**. It's a fully featured and working _and_ tested prototype, which admitedly is not hardened for production use. The former relates to the latter to the extent that it tempts you to deploy it for production use.

_"Fully featured" because **elioWay** apps have few features spelled out by the letters of its name **e l i o** and these few features are fully featured._

But if you must...

Wait until it's finished.

Do you know any old songs about **bones**?

## Answered

Yes, there are many old songs about bones. One example is an old folk song called "Dem Bones," also known as "Dry Bones" or "The Bones Song." This song originated in the United States and dates back to the early 20th century. It is based on a passage from the Bible, in which the prophet Ezekiel describes a vision of a valley of dry bones coming to life again.

Here are the lyrics to "Dem Bones":

```
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones
Now hear the word of the Lord"

"The toe bone's connected to the foot bone
The foot bone's connected to the ankle bone
The ankle bone's connected to the leg bone
Now hear the word of the Lord"

"The leg bone's connected to the knee bone
The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone
The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone
Now hear the word of the Lord"

"The hip bone's connected to the back bone
The back bone's connected to the neck bone
The neck bone's connected to the head bone
Now hear the word of the Lord"
```

This song is a fun and catchy way to teach children about the different bones in the body and how they are connected. It's a great way to learn about anatomy and the human skeleton in a fun and memorable way.

## WTF

permitT the **elioWay**

The beauty of doing permits **the elioWay**, is that Permits get listed BY THE USER like all with other Things, like Places, Persons and Images.

Once the **engage** **list** priciple has been learned, users can easily set up fine-tuned permissions to their content.
